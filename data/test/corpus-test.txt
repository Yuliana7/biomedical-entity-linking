8589722	BRCA1 is secreted and exhibits properties of a granin.	Germline mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for most cases of <category="CompositeMention">inherited breast and ovarian cancer </category>. However , the function of the BRCA1 protein has remained elusive . We now show that BRCA1 encodes a 190-kD protein with sequence homology and biochemical analogy to the granin protein family . Interestingly , BRCA2 also includes a motif similar to the granin consensus at the C terminus of the protein . Both BRCA1 and the granins localize to secretory vesicles , are secreted by a regulated pathway , are post-translationally glycosylated and are responsive to hormones . As a regulated secretory protein , BRCA1 appears to function by a mechanism not previously described for <category="Modifier">tumour</category> suppressor gene products . . 
8589723	<category="Modifier">Ovarian cancer</category> risk in BRCA1 carriers is modified by the HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus.	Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene ( on chromosome 17q21 ) , have an 80 % risk of <category="SpecificDisease">breast cancer</category> and a 40 % risk of <category="SpecificDisease">ovarian cancer</category> by the age of 70 ( ref . 1 ) . The variable penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other genetic and non-genetic factors play a role in tumourigenesis in these individuals . The HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTR ) polymorphism , located 1 kilobase ( kb ) downstream of the HRAS1 proto-oncogene ( chromosome 11p15 . 5 ) is one possible genetic modifier of <category="Modifier">cancer</category> penetrance . Individuals who have rare alleles of the VNTR have an increased risk of certain types of <category="DiseaseClass">cancers</category> , including <category="SpecificDisease">breast cancer</category> ( 2-4 ) . To investigate whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to <category="CompositeMention">hereditary breast and ovarian cancer</category> , we have typed a panel of 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR-based technique . The risk for <category="SpecificDisease">ovarian cancer</category> was 2 . 11 times greater for BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare HRAS1 alleles , compared to carriers with only common alleles ( P = 0 . 015 ) . The magnitude of the relative risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele was not altered by adjusting for the other known risk factors for <category="SpecificDisease">hereditary ovarian cancer</category> ( 5 ) . Susceptibility to <category="SpecificDisease">breast cancer</category> did not appear to be affected by the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles . This study is the first to show the effect of a modifying gene on the penetrance of an <category="DiseaseClass">inherited cancer syndrome</category>
