       "Myotonic myopathy with cylindrical spirals is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by slow relaxation of muscle fibers, leading to muscle stiffness, wasting, and weakness. This condition is also known for its unique histopathological feature of cylindrical spiral-shaped structures in the affected muscles.\n",

       "Myotonic myopathy with cylindrical spirals typically presents with progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and stiffness, affecting various muscle groups, including those involved in walking, grasping, and swallowing. The condition is usually diagnosed based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), and muscle biopsy. There is currently no cure for this disorder, but various treatments, such as physical therapy, medications, and surgery, may help manage its symptoms.\n",

    "We have experimented with a different setup for entity linking and retrieval in the previous parts, and this notebook takes the best configuration and builds on top of it as a medical assistant, that can help to retrieve relevant information on diseases. Having a knowledge base built as a knowledge graph allows us to retrieve relevant information even if it is not available for the given node and use its parent instead. This is just one example of the potential usage of the entity linking we have developed, and it does have its limitations. However, we believe that such system have a great potential for future use and a room for improvements."
